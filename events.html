            career option, the opportunities that are accessible, and the
            career path that should be pursued.
            It was attended by students from several branches of the
            college's second and third years, as well as all club members.
            This review provides a look at various robotics-related
            technologies such as ROS, Solidworks, and electronic
            simulators that were utilised as part of club activities. The
            event lasted two hours.</p>

                <h2>Robot Operating System (ROS)</h2>
                <p>Robot Operating System (ROS) is a popular industrial tool
                    for prototyping and developing robots. This is the
                    Demanding Industry tool, which is used to design robots in
                    a variety of fields. Because ROS is the most important tool
                    utilized in the competitions in which club members
                    compete, this event aims to provide excellent ROS training
                    to club members.
                    Over the course of six months, almost fifty students went
                    through an intensive ROS training program. This program
                    covers everything from the fundamentals through advanced
                    techniques, as well as a variety of intermediate tasks for
                    practice. These 50 individuals were screened out after the
                    training and assigned to teams that compete in
                    competitions</p>

                <p>The purpose of this training is to prepare members of the
                    Hardware Section for contests. Twenty students received
                    articles, tutorials, and one-on-one help from seniors. They
                    were given tasks to do and were graded on how well they
                    completed them. Students who performed well on the tasks
                    were chosen and assigned to competing teams.
                    Other students who performed below average or averagely
                    were offered further instruction by seniors and outstanding
                    students in order to strengthen their skill set.</p>

                <p>The goal of this training is to get Mechanical section
                    members ready for competitions. 5 people who applied for
                    the Mechanical segment were given solid-works Tools
                    training, which is also necessary for developing mechanical
                    robot models.
                    These five students were given resources and tasks in order
                    to get practical experience. They were later divided into
                    teams for competitions.</p>

                <p>This course is for students who are interested in using
                    machine learning in robotics. It was led by the club's ML
                    experts. This workshop was attended by approximately 20
                    students. This instruction began with Andrew-ng's course
                    of Machine-learning on the Coursera platform, followed by
                    numerus ML and Reinforcement Articles and blogs.
                    Students were given assignments to complete and were
                    graded on them. Students that excelled in this training were
                    assigned to several teams that would compete.</p>
